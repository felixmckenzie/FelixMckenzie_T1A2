        <h3>My Journey So Far:</h3>
        <p>
          I’m Felix, surfer, restaurateur, lover of science and technology, and
          a student of web development. I have a drive to create web based
          applications that have purpose and solve real world problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          My journey into web development started in 2020, when I was stuck at
          home during the pandemic. Coding was always something that fascinated
          me but I had never tried. I’ve never been afraid of giving something a
          go, so I started playing with online coding platforms, and I was
          hooked. I found it deeply satisfying to be given the scope of a
          problem and find a working solution, and then optimize it through
          iteration.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found myself customizing the css on my business’s website, and
          creating small trivial apps with my newly acquired Javascript skills I
          had learnt online. However I knew this could be a powerful tool with
          greater applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          This initial excitement grew into the pursuit for a new career in a
          new industry. In February 2022 I started a Web Developer bootcamp at
          Coder Academy, where I’m currently working towards a diploma of
          Information Technology.
