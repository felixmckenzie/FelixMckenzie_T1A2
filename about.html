          <h2>My Journey So Far:</h2>
        <p>
          I’m Felix, surfer, restaurateur, lover of science and technology,
          and a student of web development. I have a drive to create web based
          applications that have purpose and solve real world problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          My journey into web development started in 2020, when I was stuck at
          home during the pandemic. Coding was always something that
          fascinated me but I had never tried. I’ve never been afraid of
          giving something a go, so I started playing with online coding
          platforms, and I was hooked. I found it deeply satisfying to be
          given the scope of a problem and find a working solution, and then
          optimize it through iteration. 
          </p>
         <p>I found myself customizing the css
          on my business’s website, and creating small trivial apps with my
          newly acquired Javascript skills I had learnt online. However I knew
          this could be a powerful tool with greater applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          This initial excitement grew into a quest for a new career in a new
          industry. In February 2022 I started a Web Developer bootcamp at
          Coder Academy, where I’m currently working towards a diploma of
          Information Technology.
