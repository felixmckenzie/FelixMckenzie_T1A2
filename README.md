## FUNCTIONALITY & FEAUTURES
Functionality of the portfolio website centered around highlighting and conveying my experience as a web developer and displayng my contact information in a clear, easily accessible way. The following features were built to achieve the functionality outcomes:

#### Responsive Design
Responsive design was built into the site to allow greater accessibility on all devices. This was achieved using a combination of CSS grid and flexbox, enabling the layout to adjust from mobile through to desktop screen sizes. Moreover, font size was adjusted to the appropriate size using CSS variables and media queries.

#### Responsive Page Navigation 
Navigation to pages within the site is controlled through a clearly displayed header component at the top of each page. For mobile devices the navigation bar collapses to a burger style menu icon, with the full list of navigation options sliding in from the right hand side on click. 

#### PDF Resume link
A link to my resume PDF is provided within the header, highlighted in red. The PDF opens in a new tab. 

#### External Link Navigation
External links to Github, LinkedIn and Twitter are provided in a seperate navigation bar running down the lefthand side of the home page. These links are highlighted when hovered and collapse to a row under the hamburger icon on mobile devices. 

#### Footer 
A footer is used universally throughout the portfolio with my personal contact information i.e. email address and phone number, this allows potential employers to contact me quickly and easily.
